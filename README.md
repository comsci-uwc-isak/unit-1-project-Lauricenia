 <details><summary>Defining the context (100-150 words)-Topic 1.1.1</summary>
 A car rental office needs a computer program for recording information about their orders with the purpose of collecting basic information about the distance driven for each car. The/most stakeholders have no understanding in programing and no previous interaction with a computer system was mentioned; therefore, they must have never dealt with this type of system so the program must have simple features that don’t require programing skills, provides clear instructions and also a simple and transparent installation. These features are, specifically, easy commands to allow to create a car, record a trip distance, query the trip history a car, edit, delete a car and see the total statistics. Since this data will be recorded in a storage, it’s important to have a back-up in case any data gets lots from users input errors or system errors.
